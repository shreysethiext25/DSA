The twoSum function finds two indices in the nums array whose elements sum to a given target. It uses a nested loop to check each pair of elements. When a pair is found, it allocates memory for a result array, stores the indices, sets returnSize to 2, and returns the result array. If no pair is found, it returns returnSize, which is inappropriate as it should indicate no valid pair found.
